<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

Whether you're a freelance developer looking for clients, a junior developer looking for your first development job, or a senior-level developer with years of experience, having a portfolio is essential. Your portfolio will help you showcase your skills and stand out from your peers during your job search. While in the process of creating a web portfolio my biggest issue was finding a style that truly represented me as a developer and a person. With my third iteration I firmly believe that this design perfectly satisfies all of my needs and wants.
